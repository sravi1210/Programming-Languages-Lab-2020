# No extra assumption is taken other than decided for this question, which are -
	1. Same variety of rooms will have same sizes.
	2. The initial shape of the plot isn't fixed, it can be any polygon, thus only area is considered.
	3. The diimensions can only be integers.

# Simulation Time Limit
	This simualtion might take 30 seconds to produce result in the worst case, which is the best time limit among any other solution possible, assuming no extra assumptions were made.
